Objective: Develop machine learning models to predict income levels based on demographic and occupational data, focusing on individuals earning above or below $50,000.

Data Preparation: Cleaned and preprocessed data from the U.S. Census Bureau, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the dataset for training and testing.

Modeling and Evaluation: Implemented XGBoost and Random Forest classifiers to predict income and identify key influential factors. The XGBoost model achieved an accuracy of approximately 87.53%, with a focus on accuracy and bias mitigation.
